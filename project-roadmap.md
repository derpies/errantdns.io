# ErrantDNS Project Outline - Revised Roadmap

## Current Architecture Assessment

Your codebase now has:
- ✅ Complete DNS server with miekg/dns
- ✅ PostgreSQL storage with connection pooling
- ✅ In-memory caching layer
- ✅ Comprehensive record validation (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, MX, NS, SOA, PTR, SRV, CAA)
- ✅ Redis client library ready for integration
- ✅ Good test infrastructure
- ✅ Configuration management
- ✅ Basic monitoring/stats

## Phase 1: Redis Cache Integration (Immediate Priority)

**Goal**: Replace/enhance the current cached storage with Redis as the L2 cache

### 1.1 Redis Storage Layer Integration
- Create `internal/storage/redis_cached.go` that integrates your Redis library
- Implement Redis as L2 cache between in-memory (L1) and PostgreSQL
- Cache structure: Memory → Redis → PostgreSQL
- Implement cache invalidation strategies across both layers
- Add Redis health checks to the storage health system

### 1.2 Redis Configuration
- Extend `internal/config/config.go` to include Redis settings
- Support for multiple Redis deployment patterns (single, cluster, sentinel)
- Environment variable configuration for Redis connection details
- Connection pooling and timeout configurations

### 1.3 Performance Validation
- Ensure Redis integration doesn't degrade performance
- Implement cache hit/miss ratio monitoring for both L1 and L2
- Add Redis-specific metrics to the stats system

## Phase 2: Complete DNS Core (Enhanced Enterprise Support)

**Goal**: Ensure all enterprise-critical DNS record types are fully supported

### 2.1 Additional Enterprise Record Types
- **NAPTR records**: For telecommunication services
- **TLSA records**: For DNS-based Authentication of Named Entities (DANE)
- **SSHFP records**: SSH fingerprint records
- **URI records**: For service discovery
- **HINFO records**: Host information (if needed)

### 2.2 Enhanced Record Validation
- Cross-record validation (e.g., ensure MX targets have A/AAAA records)
- DNSSEC preparation (even if not implementing yet)
- Enterprise-specific validation rules
- Bulk validation for record imports

### 2.3 DNS Server Enhancements
- Enhanced error handling and logging
- Better SOA record handling for zone authority
- Improved query logging for troubleshooting
- Protocol-level optimizations

## Phase 3: Wildcard Implementation

**Goal**: Implement the positional wildcard framework you've designed

### 3.1 Pattern Storage Enhancement
- Extend PostgreSQL schema to support wildcard bitmasks
- Implement ETLD extraction and storage
- Add wildcard_mask and subdomain_labels fields
- Create indexes for efficient wildcard matching

### 3.2 Wildcard Resolution Engine
- Implement the three-tier precedence system in `internal/resolver/`
- Add pattern matching algorithms
- Integrate with existing cache layers (both memory and Redis)
- Implement the left-to-right positional precedence logic

### 3.3 Wildcard Management Tools
- Pattern validation and conflict detection
- Testing tools for wildcard patterns
- Migration tools for existing records to wildcard-enabled schema

## Phase 4: REST/gRPC API Layer

**Goal**: Provide comprehensive management API with optional resolution endpoints

### 4.1 API Design and Implementation
- REST API using Go standard library or Gin/Echo
- gRPC API with Protocol Buffers
- DNS record CRUD operations
- Bulk operations for record management
- Query API endpoint for DNS resolution (as discussed)

### 4.2 API Features
- Authentication and authorization
- Rate limiting
- Input validation and sanitization
- Comprehensive error handling
- API versioning strategy

### 4.3 API Documentation
- OpenAPI/Swagger documentation
- gRPC service definitions
- Client SDK generation
- Usage examples and tutorials

## Phase 5: Web UI

**Goal**: User-friendly interface for DNS management

### 5.1 Technology Selection
- React or Vue.js for broad hirability
- Modern build tooling (Vite/Webpack)
- Component library (Material-UI, Ant Design, or Tailwind)
- Client-side routing and state management

### 5.2 Core Features
- DNS record management interface
- Wildcard pattern configuration
- Real-time validation feedback
- Bulk import/export functionality
- Analytics and monitoring dashboards

### 5.3 User Experience
- Responsive design for mobile/tablet
- Accessibility compliance
- Progressive web app features
- Comprehensive help system

## Phase 6: Enterprise Monitoring and Logging

**Goal**: Production-ready observability

### 6.1 Metrics and Monitoring
- Prometheus metrics integration
- Custom DNS metrics (query rates, record types, cache performance)
- Redis performance metrics
- Database performance metrics
- Alert definitions and thresholds

### 6.2 Logging Infrastructure
- Structured logging with configurable levels
- AWS S3 integration for log archival
- Log rotation and retention policies
- Correlation IDs for request tracing
- Security event logging

### 6.3 Operational Dashboards
- Grafana dashboard templates
- Real-time performance monitoring
- Capacity planning metrics
- Error rate and latency tracking

## Phase 7: Production Hardening

**Goal**: Enterprise deployment readiness

### 7.1 Security
- TLS/mTLS for all communications
- API authentication and RBAC
- Input sanitization and rate limiting
- Security headers and CORS policies
- Audit logging

### 7.2 Deployment and Operations
- Docker containerization optimization
- Kubernetes manifests and Helm charts
- Health checks and readiness probes
- Graceful shutdown and rolling updates
- Backup and disaster recovery procedures

### 7.3 Performance and Scalability
- Load testing and optimization
- Database query optimization
- Cache tuning and monitoring
- Horizontal scaling strategies
- CDN integration for static assets

## Key Technical Considerations

### Redis Integration Strategy
- Implement as middleware between current cached storage and PostgreSQL
- Use JSON serialization for complex DNS record structures
- Implement consistent hashing for Redis cluster support
- Add circuit breaker pattern for Redis failures

### Wildcard Framework Implementation
- Leverage existing ETLD extraction code in `internal/models/domain-name.go`
- Extend bitmask processing for efficient pattern matching
- Integrate with Mozilla Public Suffix List updates
- Design for high-performance pattern resolution

### API Design Principles
- RESTful design with clear resource hierarchies
- Idempotent operations where possible
- Comprehensive error responses with actionable messages
- Version API from day one
- Support both synchronous and asynchronous operations

### Monitoring Integration
- Design metrics to be Prometheus-compatible from the start
- Implement structured logging with consistent field names
- Plan for distributed tracing integration
- Include business metrics alongside technical metrics

## Immediate Next Steps

**Priority 1**: Begin Phase 1 (Redis Cache Integration)
- Start with `internal/storage/redis_cached.go` implementation
- Integrate Redis configuration into existing config system
- Implement L1 (Memory) → L2 (Redis) → L3 (PostgreSQL) caching hierarchy

**Priority 2**: Complete testing framework for Redis integration
- Extend existing test suite to include Redis scenarios
- Add integration tests for cache consistency
- Performance benchmarking with Redis in the stack
