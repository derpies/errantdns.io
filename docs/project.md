# High-Volume DNS Service with Nested Wildcards

## Project Overview
This document outlines the architecture and design considerations for building a high-performance DNS service in Golang with support for advanced wildcard patterns.

## Core Requirements
1. Standard DNS protocol implementation
2. Support for nested wildcards (e.g., `*.sub1.*.domain.com`)
3. High performance to handle large query volumes
4. Redis-based distributed caching
5. PostgreSQL for persistent storage

## Technology Stack

### Core DNS Handling
- **miekg/dns**: Primary library for DNS protocol implementation
  - Handles DNS message parsing, serialization
  - Provides server and client implementations
  - Supports all standard DNS record types

### Runtime Environment
- **Golang**: Primary implementation language
  - Leverages goroutines for concurrent request handling
  - Benefits from Go's garbage collection and memory safety

### Caching Layer
- **In-memory cache**: First-tier response caching
- **Redis**: Distributed second-tier caching
  - Consider go-redis/redis library
  - Implement Redis Cluster for horizontal scaling
  - Cache TTL aligned with DNS record TTLs

### Persistent Storage
- **PostgreSQL**: For configuration and zone data
  - Use pgx driver for optimal performance
  - Design schema with proper indexing for domain lookups
  - Consider table partitioning for large datasets

## Architecture Components

### 1. DNS Protocol Layer
- Implement using miekg/dns
- Handle standard DNS query/response lifecycle
- Support for all common record types (A, AAAA, CNAME, TXT, etc.)
- Implement proper error handling for DNS protocol specifics

### 2. Domain Pattern Matching System

#### Data Structure
- Specialized trie (prefix tree) for domain pattern matching
- Each node represents a domain label component
- Special handling for wildcard nodes
- Store resolution data at leaf nodes

#### Pattern Representation
- Break patterns into component labels
- Define clear semantics for wildcard matching
- Support for exact matching, single-label wildcards, and multi-label wildcards

#### Matching Algorithm
- Implement reverse-order traversal (TLD first)
- Define precedence rules when multiple patterns match
  - Exact matches prioritized over wildcards
  - More specific patterns prioritized over general ones
  - Implement scoring system for conflicts

#### Optimization
- Pre-compile patterns into optimized structures
- Consider deterministic finite automaton (DFA) approach
- Implement fast-path for common lookups

### 3. Cache Management
- Implement multi-level caching strategy
  - L1: In-memory for highest performance
  - L2: Redis for distribution across instances
- Cache both resolved results and compiled pattern trees
- Implement cache invalidation based on TTL and updates
- Use read-through/write-through pattern for consistency

### 4. Configuration Management
- Decouple DNS logic from configuration storage
- Design schema for storing pattern definitions
- Implement validation logic for patterns
- Create APIs for pattern management

### 5. Monitoring and Operations
- Implement Prometheus metrics for:
  - Query rates and latencies
  - Cache hit/miss ratios
  - Pattern matching performance
- Structured logging for operational visibility
- Health check endpoints
- Consider OpenTelemetry for distributed tracing

## Implementation Roadmap

### Phase 1: Core DNS Implementation
- Set up basic DNS server using miekg/dns
- Implement standard record handling
- Create basic configuration loading

### Phase 2: Pattern Matching System
- Implement trie-based pattern matcher
- Support for single wildcards
- Extend to nested wildcards
- Define and implement precedence rules

### Phase 3: Caching and Storage
- Implement in-memory caching
- Add Redis integration
- Design and implement PostgreSQL schema
- Create data access layer

### Phase 4: Performance Optimization
- Profile and optimize pattern matching
- Implement query parallelization
- Optimize cache usage patterns
- Fine-tune database queries

### Phase 5: Monitoring and Operations
- Add metrics collection
- Implement structured logging
- Create operational dashboards
- Deployment automation

## Considerations for Nested Wildcard Implementation

### Pattern Definition
- Clear syntax for defining nested wildcards
- Documentation of matching semantics
- Validation rules to prevent ambiguous patterns

### Performance Implications
- Nested wildcards will be more computationally expensive
- Heavy caching required for frequently accessed patterns
- Consider precomputing common query results

### Conflict Resolution
- Explicit rules for when multiple patterns match
- UI to visualize potential conflicts
- Testing tools to verify expected behavior

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for pattern matching logic
- Integration tests for full DNS resolution
- Performance benchmarks for query handling
- Load testing to verify high-volume capabilities
- Chaos testing for resilience verification

## Security Considerations
- Input validation for all pattern definitions
- Protection against DNS amplification attacks
- Rate limiting for query sources
- DNSSEC considerations
- Access controls for configuration management
